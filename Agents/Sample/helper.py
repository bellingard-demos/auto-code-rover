The data was collected by monitoring various cybersecurity metrics in a network environment. The purpose of the data collection is to assess and predict potential cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.",\n  "variables": [\n    {{\n      "description": "Level of cybersecurity threat",\n      "name": "cybersecurity_threat",\n      "is_target": true\n    }},\n    {{\n      "description": "Number of failed login attempts",\n      "name": "failed_login_attempts"\n    }},\n    {{\n      "description": "Amount of encrypted data",\n      "name": "encrypted_data"\n    }},\n    {{\n      "description": "Frequency of software updates",\n      "name": "software_updates"\n    }},\n    {{\n      "description": "Number of antivirus software installed",\n      "name": "antivirus_software"\n    }},\n    {{\n      "description": "Quality of firewall protection",\n      "name": "firewall_quality"\n    }}\n  ],\n  "relationship": {{\n    "dependent": "cybersecurity_threat",\n    "relation": "-53.5*encrypted_data**2 - 53.85*failed_login_attempts**2 + 67.75*firewall_quality - 92.16 - 36.68/software_updates**3"\n  }}\n}}```\nGiven this dataset, the following is a valid answer:\n```json\n{{\n  "broad": {{\n    "instruction": "Be vague. Only indicate which concepts might be related but not how they are related",\n    "hypothesis": "Threat to cybersecurity is influenced by several factors including the amount of encrypted data, the number of failed login attempts, the quality of the firewall, as well as how often the software is updated."\n  }},\n  "medium": {{\n    "instruction": "Be slightly more specific. For each factor, indicate carefully whether it positively or negatively affects the relationship, but do not indicate what the exponent is.",\n    "hypothesis": "Cybersecurity threat tends to decrease with the amount of data encryption, the number of failed login attempts, as well as the frequency of software updates to some extent, while improvement in the firewall quality has a positive effect."\n  }},\n  "narrow": {{\n    "instruction": "Be specific. Communicate the concepts, whether there is a positive or negative effect (be careful), and the meaning of the exponent",\n    "hypothesis": "The threat to cybersecurity interacts in a complex manner with various factors. As the amount of encrypted data increases, there is a quadratic decrease in threat. Similarly for the number of failed login attempts, there is a negative quadratic relationship. The quality of the firewall protection on the other hand demonstrates a positive and linear relationship. Finally, the frequency of software updates has an inverse cubic relationship to the threat."\n  }},\n}}\n```\n\nBased on this, provide an answer for the following test dataset:\n```json\n{dataset}```\nRespond only with a JSON.',
